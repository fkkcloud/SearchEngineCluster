I was thinking of google search as one of the most high-end artificial intelligence that 
most of people interact with everyday.
When you search for a thing, it does pretty good job on catching what you are searching for.
It gives you result that everyone could sympathize and most of the time the result is
exactly what you are looking for or what everybody is looking for.

What if exactly what you are looking for is what everybody else is looking for cause a disadvantages?
I mean, the A.I is actually telling us what is right answer for the query to everyone.
It is making us to think simplified and see a single problem in exactly same way as other people see.

However, people is an inventive creature. 
We have to think and see the problem in humongous different ways and
connect the different meanings to invent a new thing.

If you search for query "Apple" in google search, on the first page of the result, all you ever see is
about Apple Inc, maybe iCloud at the end.


Of course, that is most of people are happy to see as result but does this have enough
diversity of meaning for a query to widen one's intellectual horizon?

What if the similar category of the result can be clustered as one?
All the stuff related to Apple Inc, can be clustered as one in first link of the list.
Second link of the list can be cluster about real fruit apple, third can be IBM as result of
historical data mining and other clusters can be different meaning about the word apple.


I want to make it more dynamic by introducing 3 dimensional layout of the search result.
When you are thinking of something that you saw somewhere but you don't remember the name,
you start searching it with a related keyword. By searching with the keyword and from the result you
choose most related keyword and you repeat this step until you find what you are searching for. 
It draws a hierarchical path from first keyword to what you are searching for.
What if you see the hierarchical path as flattened in 3 dimensional hierarchical map?

You can find what you are looking for at one step or see all the different branches from the tree-map
about the single query to link those nodes to invent a new interesting idea.

This will benefit 2 things.
1. Diversity which is divided by data mining would allow us to widen our intellectual horizon which lead
us to be creative.
2. Help us to find a thing in a very quickly way by looking at the hierarchy at once.
CLUSTERING TEST / WIP


Next step that I am woking on 
1. Implementation of hierarchical search result in 3 dimensional hierarchical map.
2. GUI to let user to select 2 or 3 nodes and see if that results an interesting ideas.
